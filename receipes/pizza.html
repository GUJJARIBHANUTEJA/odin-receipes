    <h2>ingridents</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Flour: All-purpose flour is standard, but "00" flour or bread flour (which is higher in gluten) will create a crispier, chewier crust.</li>
        <li>Yeast: Active dry yeast or instant yeast (1 teaspoon or 1 packet).</li>
        <li>Water: Lukewarm water (105°F–115°F) is crucial for activating the yeast without killing it.</li>
        <li>Sugar: A small amount (1 teaspoon) to help the yeast activate and improve browning.</li>
        <li>Olive Oil: Extra virgin olive oil adds flavor and keeps the dough tender.</li>
        <li>Salt: Essential for flavor, generally 1 teaspoon.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Procedure</h3>
    <p>
        To make pizza from scratch, start by
activating your yeast in warm water with a pinch of sugar until it becomes frothy, then mix it with flour, salt, and olive oil to form a dough. Knead the mixture for about 5–10 minutes until smooth and elastic, and let it rise in a warm, draft-free place until it has doubled in size. While the dough proofs, prepare a thick tomato sauce by simmering pureed tomatoes with garlic, herbs, and seasoning. Once the dough is ready, punch it down to release air, stretch or roll it into a thin circle on a floured surface, and transfer it to a preheated baking sheet or pizza stone. Spread a light layer of sauce over the base, leaving a small border for the crust, then add a generous layer of mozzarella cheese and your favorite toppings like pepperoni or sliced vegetables. Finally, bake the pizza in a very hot oven—ideally 230–260°C (450–500°F)—for 8–15 minutes until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbling and melted.
